Data Description file for Dataset: Neighbour Enrichment - All Categories

Description: Dataset of target annotations collected using the Neibhour Enrichment function in STRING, which includes annotations from nearest neighbour proteins to the input target.
The predictive features in this dataset include all 8 feature categories considered in the study, namely:
Gene Ontology Term (either Molecular Function, Cellular Components, or Biological Processe)
Pathways from either KEGG, Reactome or WikiPathways
InterPro Protein Domains
UniProt Keywords.

Special Columns:	Category	Description
Index	ID	Unique identifier for the compound/sex combination (instance) in the data. Ignored when training the classification model.
Compound_name	ID	Name of the compound (drug). Ignored when training the classification model.
class	Target Variable	Class label, with 0 indicating that the drug/sex combination is NOT associated with mouse longevity, and 1 indicating that it IS associated with mouse longevity, based on results from peer-reviewed studies.

Predictive Features:	Category	Description
sex	Other	M for male mice and F for female mice, transformed into a binary value when training the model.
