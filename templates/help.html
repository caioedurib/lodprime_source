            All details regarding the data preparation and experimental setup is included in the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.29.620854v1" target="_blank">source paper</a>.<br>
            Here, we include a summary of that information:
            <h5>Machine learning models:</h5>
            <p><b>For the Target Prediction tool:</b> Prediction outputs are obtained from ensembles of 5 Random Forest models (different ensembles for male and female mice, selected based on each models'
              performance in our experiments). The features used to describe each compound are annotations associated with their user-provided protein targets, which include
             Gene Ontology, InterPro protein domains, UniProt Keywords and Pathway data from KEGG, Wiki and Reactome.</p>
            <p><b>For the Chemical Prediction tool:</b> Prediction outputs are obtained from a single Random Forest model (different models for male and female mice). The features used to describe each compound are
            binary values from PubChem's molecular fingerprints describing chemical substructures that are present/absent in the compound's composition.</p>
            <h5>Class label definition:</h5>
            <p>A compound is considered a member of the positive class (associated with mouse longevity) if mice treated with it had at least 5% average lifespan increase in the majority
              of experimental reports from peer-reviewed studies, with significant results (data sourced from the DrugAge database). Compounds may have different class labels for male and
              female mice, as results for each sex are considered separately.</p>
            <h5>Predictions for male and female mice:</h5>
            <p>The male mouse predictions are from models trained exclusively with examples from male mice, which had the best predictive accuracy performance in our experiments.
            For female mice, we lacked enough data to obtain reliable female-only models so the predictions are obtained from mixed-sex datasets. Predictions for female mice are less reliable (please see the source paper for a detailed discussion of the experimental results).
            <h5>Implementation:</h5>
            <p>This web service was implemented in Python, using the Flask framework for the website portion.
              All models were trained using the sklearn library (v1.1.0), using the datasets provided in the  <a href="{{prefix}}/data">Data</a> page. We selected the models for the ensembles in this tool based on their cross-validation experimental results.
              The data was preprocessed to remove features with fewer than 3 occurrences ('1' values). Otherwise, Target models include all STRING annotations from the selected categories, and Chemical models include all chemical substructures in the fingerprint.</p>
