    <h3>Welcome to MiceLongevity</h3>
      <p>This tool provides predictions from machine learning models for whether a compoundâ€™s protein targets make it likely to increase mice longevity.</p>
      <p>Go to the <a href="/input">Input</a> page and provide examples of compounds and their protein targets to get predictions.</p>
      <p>We have also made all datasets used to generate the models from this project available for download in the <a href="/data">Data</a> tab.</p>
      <p>Please see the <a href="/help">Help</a> page for examples of how to use the tool, additional information and links to external resources. </p>
