    <h3>Welcome to MiceLongevity</h3>
      <p>A tool that provides predictions from machine learning models for whether a compoundâ€™s protein targets make it likely to be associated with mice longevity.</p>
      <p>To get predictions, go to the <a href="/input">Input</a> page and provide examples of compounds and their protein targets.</p>
      <p>We have also made all datasets used to generate the models from this project available for download in the <a href="/data">Data</a> tab.</p>
      <p>Please see the <a href="/help">Help</a> page for a tutorial with examples of how to use the tool, and details about its implementation. </p>
